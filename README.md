# Holidaze Booking Application

A response booking application that allows users to register an account with a @stud.noroff.no email address. The user may register as a venue manager or as a guest. A venue manager user may create and update venues to be booked.

This application is a React SPA styled with CSS Modules. It uses yup form resolver for validation, and a mixture of the react useContext API and localStorage to store the user object and authorize user actions.
